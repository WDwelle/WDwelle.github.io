## My name is William Dwelle

Here I will showcase some of my projects and stuff about me.

I graduated from the Coding Dojo Full Stack development bootcamp in February of 2022.

###Python
I fell in love with the simple syntax and power of python. I learned to connect to API's and connect to a mySQL database.

###Java
The structure of Java and my very little experience using **C# in Unity** game engine made it fairly easy for me to pickup an d learn.

###M.E.R.N.
MERN standing for **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React** and **Node.js** is a great tool for quickly building out websites and I have just scratched the service of possibilities.

##My focus
I would like to focus on backend development and testing. I enjoy working with and sorting data pools and can't wait to make a career out of it.
